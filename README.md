# Text-Generation-AI
Next Word Prediction
## Description
Text Generation AI - Next Word Prediction is a technology that utilizes artificial intelligence to generate the most likely next word or phrase in a given sequence of words. It analyzes patterns and relationships in large amounts of text data using natural language processing techniques. By considering the context of previous words, the AI model can predict the next word with a high degree of accuracy. This AI application has various uses, such as aiding in writing emails, composing text messages, and enhancing productivity in writing tasks. It can also be integrated into chatbots and virtual assistants to generate natural-sounding responses. However, the accuracy of predictions depends on the quality of the training data and the model architecture used. Ongoing research aims to improve these models and make them more reliable in different applications.

## Dependent Libraries 
The following libraries are used:
1. `random`: This library provides functions for generating random numbers and performing randomization tasks.
2. `pickle`: This library is used for serializing and deserializing Python objects. It allows you to save objects to a file and load them back into memory.
3. `heapq`: This library provides functions for creating and manipulating heap data structures. Heaps are useful for tasks such as finding the smallest or largest items in a collection efficiently.
4. `numpy` (imported as `np`): NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
5. `pandas` (imported as `pd`): Pandas is a widely used library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures such as DataFrames for storing and manipulating tabular data, as well as functions for data cleaning, merging, reshaping, and more.
6. `matplotlib.pyplot` (imported as `plt`): Matplotlib is a plotting library that enables the creation of various types of visualizations in Python. The `pyplot` module provides a simple interface for creating plots, histograms, scatter plots, and more.
7. `nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer`: This class from the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library is used for tokenizing text using regular expressions. It splits the text into individual tokens based on specified patterns.
8. `tensorflow` (imported as `tf`): TensorFlow is a popular open-source library for machine learning and deep learning. It provides a flexible framework for building and training different types of neural network models.
9. `tensorflow.keras.models.Sequential`: This class from TensorFlow's Keras API is used to create sequential models, which are linear stacks of layers. It allows you to define and configure the layers of a neural network in sequence.
10. `tensorflow.keras.layers`: This module provides various types of layers that can be used to build neural networks. In this case, it includes the `LSTM` and `Dense` layers, commonly used for recurrent and fully connected layers, respectively.
11. `tensorflow.keras.optimizers.RMSprop`: This class represents the RMSprop optimization algorithm, which is a popular choice for training neural networks. It adjusts the learning rate adaptively based on the gradient magnitudes.
